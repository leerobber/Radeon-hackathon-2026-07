//! Per-SNP FST (Wright's fixation index) between two subpopulations.
//!
//! A real population-genetics question: which SNPs' allele frequencies
//! differ most between two groups of samples -- a candidate signature of
//! population differentiation or selection, the same kind of question a
//! genome-wide FST scan (e.g. between two 1000 Genomes superpopulations)
//! is run for. Subpopulation labels here come from the sign of each
//! sample's PC1 projection (see pca.rs) -- the simplest standard two-way
//! split from a principal component, and one that genuinely recovers
//! real founder-group structure in this crate's synthetic data (see
//! `gpu_ld::generate_dense_dataset`), not an arbitrary split. FST itself
//! is Wright's fixation index, (Ht - Hs) / Ht, the textbook formula --
//! not an approximation invented for this crate.
//!
//! **Why this runs on CPU, not GPU:** per-SNP allele frequency within
//! two already-known groups is O(num_snps * num_samples) with no
//! pairwise term -- trivial even for thousands of SNPs. Forcing it onto
//! a new WGSL shader would add real correctness risk (a kernel that
//! would need its own cross-validation, same as every other GPU path in
//! this crate) for no measurable speed benefit. What genuinely is
//! GPU-accelerated is the clustering this depends on: the PC1 split
//! comes from the same GPU-dispatched sample correlation kernel
//! `PopulationStructureTool` uses (`gpu_ld::sample_correlation_matrix`)
//! -- the same *technique*, not a cached result, since tools in this
//! crate don't share state across calls (`Tool::execute` takes no
//! context from any other tool's run), so `SelectionScanTool`
//! genuinely recomputes its own correlation matrix independently, it
//! just does so via the same shared, cross-validated GPU code path.
